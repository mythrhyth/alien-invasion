   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

python alien_invasion.py
```

## Game Controls

- **Arrow keys** - Move the spaceship left or right
- **Spacebar** - Fire bullets
- **Q** - Quit the game

## Code Structure

The project is organized into several modules for better maintainability:

- `alien_invasion.py`: The main script to run the game.
- `settings.py`: Contains game settings like screen size, ship speed, etc.
- `game_functions.py`: Tracks game statistics like score and high score.
- `button.py`: Handles button creation and functionality for the game's start screen.
- `ship.py`: Manages the player's spaceship.
- `bullet.py`: Manages the bullets fired by the spaceship.
- `alien.py`: Manages the alien enemies.
- `scoreboard.py`: Handles the display of the score, high score, and level.
- `game_functions.py`: Contains the main game functions such as event handling, updating the screen, and checking for collisions.
